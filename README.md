# SpoofEmailer2

A semi complex Spoof emailer. No bugs or errors, that I can find, if you find any please let me know so I can do a quick fix

Also, for the smtp setup, I found that either using AWS with an smtp service or smtp2go works really well. So enjoy!

You will need to install the krypton component system into VS, but if not, the files are already created for you to use the mailer. If you decide to edit the program and build the solution it will pop out the exe and a dll file. If you want it to only have the exe file, you will need an external program called ILMerge which will allow you to bind the exe and dll files together. The krypton pack is here https://github.com/ComponentFactory/Krypton and the ILMerge Program is here https://wvd-vegt.bitbucket.io/ilmergegui.html
